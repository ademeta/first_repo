Let's say you had commits:

C
B
A
git revert B, will create a commit that undoes changes in B.

git revert A, will create a commit that undoes changes in A, but will not touch changes in B

Note that if changes in B are dependent on changes in A, the revert of A is not possible.

git reset --soft A, will change the commit history and repository; staging and working directory will still be at state of C.

git reset --mixed A, will change the commit history, repository, and staging; working directory will still be at state of C.

git reset --hard A, will change the commit history, repository, staging and working directory; you will go back to the state of A completely.
